This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: division by zero. The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to divide an integer by zero. This leads to undefined behavior, often resulting in program crashes. The `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version that handles the potential for division by zero.
